# DL3
Repository for DL3 - Project.

## Tasks
???

## Python environment
1. Set up a virtual environment (only has to be done once): `python3.11 -m venv dl-venv`.

2. Activate virtual environment: `source dl-venv/bin/activate` or `dl-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

## What's odd
- Tensorflow doesn't recognise my GPU, but torch does. Maybe it's this bug's fault: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/38990
