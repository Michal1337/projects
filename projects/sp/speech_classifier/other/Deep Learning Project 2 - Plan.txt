DATASET

30 classes, 64 721 samples

Train-val-test split bases on the provided validation_list.txt and testing_list.txt files

Make sure each waveforms is 1 second long, pad shorter ones with zeros to 16000 length

Transform waveforms into spectrograms, maybe test some parameters

base params: frame_length=255, frame_step=128

MODELS

ConvNet - Conv2D + MaxPooling2D

Transformer - squeeze the last dimension to get 3D tensors

Whisper (fine-tuning):

- tiny - 39M params

- base - 74M params

- small - 244M params (maybe)

Test different parameters for ConvNet (number of  filters, kernel size, stride) and Transformer(n_emebd, n_head, n_layers)

Accuracy and loss to measure performance 

DATA AUGMENTATION (?)

Augment some samples with background noise provided in _background_noise_ folder
